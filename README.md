                            OPS PERSON #1
        Sir, you're not going to believe this, Jason Bornne is on the line.


                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        People now is the time.  We need to find Bornne now.  We will not let him get away. 


                            JASON BORNNE
        I KNOW you killed Stephens.  
        I KNOW you killed Mayweather.  
        But why are you targeting Branson.  He doesn't know anything about the operation. 

                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        Borne, there are things going on that are even above MY rank.  


                            OPS PERSON #2
        Sir, we've triangulated his phone.  Phone configuration hash: "a89b97c129a"


                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        Ok, cross reference that hash with calls made from Paris on Monday night.


                            OPS PERSON #3
        Running cross reference. 
        ...Um, .... 
        The UI is running a bit slow right now.
      
      
Shows UI with spinning loading icon.


                            OPS PERSON #2
                      (To ops person #3.  Annoyed.)
        You have to run a filter before you run a cross reference.
        You ran the cross reference first.
        Cancel out that command.
        

                            OPS PERSON #3
        Sir.  I'm trying to cancel the command.  
        The UI is totally stuck.
        
        
                            OPS PERSON #1
                              (Annoyed)
        Hit Ctrl-C.   

                            OPS PERSON #3
                             (Frustrated)
        I am hitting Ctrl-C.  
        See!   
        
Clicks on keyboard.

                            OPS PERSON #3
        Ctrl-C, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-C.
        Stuck!
        
                            OPS PERSON #1
                              (Annoyed)
        Well, just close the panel.  
        And start the panel again.


                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        Let's go gentlemen.  Let's get that cross-reference.


                            JASON BORNNE
        What's going on!  Don't play me Howard!


                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        Look.  Jason.  We got a lot of things in play right now.


                            OPS PERSON #1
        We've patched in the video feed.  
        It's coming in now, sir.  
        
                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        Main screen.
        
        
Screen shows scrambled video feed.


                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        What's wrong!?  
        What's going on!?
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
                              (Excited)
        He's scrambled the feed!  
        ... no ... wait... actually ...
        I think the security camera is using some obscure video codec, sir.
        
                             OPS PERSON #2
        The auto-conversion should be able to handle that.  
        Why isn't the auto-conversion running?



Janet walks up slowly.  Hands in pocket.  Points to screen.

                            Janet (Ops Person #4)
        Did you reboot your system this morning
         
         
                            OPS PERSON #3
        No!  Why would I do that!?

                            Janet (Ops Person #4)
        They sent a message this morning saying we had to reboot the system to get all the latest updates.

                            OPS PERSON #3
        What message?! 
        I didn't get a message.  
        What DL was that?!

                            Janet (Ops Person #4)
        No, it was on Slack.
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
        Slack! What channel?

                            Janet (Ops Person #4)
        I think,  "TL-internal".
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
        "TL-internal"!  I'm not on that.

                            Janet (Ops Person #4)
        Yes you are.  
        See "TL-internal".  
        Right there 8:12am.  
        It says, "Important.  Update the system to get latest updates."  
        It has like 20 replies.
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
        Oh jeez.  I must have skimmed it.

                            Janet (Ops Person #4)
        It says "Important"


                            OPS PERSON #2
        You're going to have to run the conversion manually.

                            OPS PERSON #3
        How do you do that?
        
                            OPS PERSON #2
        Hey Janet, how do we run manual conversion if we don't have the latest updates.
        
                            Janet (Ops Person #4)
        Just pipe the stream but you have to tell the conversion what the codec is.  Do you know the codec.
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
        Ummm.... no! .
        
                            Janet (Ops Person #4)
        You can give the conversion executable an argument to see if it can pre-determine the codec.
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
        What's the argument!?
        
                            Janet (Ops Person #4)
        I don't know.  I never needed it because I always keep my system up to date.
        
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
        I'm on it! 
        .... reading help page 
        .... reading help page


        Found it sir.  It's "-f".

Treadstone commander looks confused and mildy unimpressed.


                            JASON BORNNE
        I'm going to need some assurances.


                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        I have no problem with that.


                            OPS PERSON #3
        Video feed should work now sir.
        
        
                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        Pan the camera to the left.  Let's see if we can make out that device he's holding.

Camera pans right.

                            OPS PERSON #2
        Camera is a little hard to control.
        
Camera pans left too far.  Finally, he's able to get camera centered.


                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        And zoom.
        
        
Camera zooms into Bornne's ear.

                            OPS PERSON #2
        I told you this camera is hard to control.


                            OPS PERSON #3
        I'm trying to change the city reference to Paris but the UI wont let me.  
        Look, I'm clicking.  
        It's totally stuck.
        
                            OPS PERSON #1
        You have to hit submit first.
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
        Why do I have to do that!!! 
        I set the panel to... 
        Oh, yeah.  
        I have to hit submit.
        
        Ok done.  I have his phone hash cross-referenced to Paris.

                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        Great!  Execute command!


Man talking on phone.  Shows downtown Paris, Texas in background.

                            MAN  
        The Lakers.  There is no way!  They need a big man more than they need...
        

Phone explodes!  Man dies.


                            OPS PERSON #1
        You have it set to Paris, Texas.  
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
        Why is it set to Paris Texas!?
        
                            OPS PERSON #1
        It's going to default to your locale, United States.  
        That's why its set to Paris, Texas.  
        You need to set it to Paris, France.
        
                            OPS PERSON #3
        Righhht.

        
        Cross referenced to Paris.... France, Sir.


                            TREADSTONE COMMANDER  
        Execute command!

Phone explodes!  Jason Bornne dies.
